# JavaScript_UFO_Sightings
## Resources

- **Data Source:** data.js (Java Script File)
- **Software:** JavaScript, HTML,  Visual Code Editor, CSS

## Overview of Project

Using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, I created a custom webpage that showcases different UFO sightings worldwide. To display this data, I created a table to organize UFO data stored as a JavaScript array. This table can filter the data table array using text box search criteria set up using the JS D3 library. JavaScript was the primary coding language to program the webpage using HTML. At the same time, CSS and Bootstrap were used to help style the HTML webpage.
